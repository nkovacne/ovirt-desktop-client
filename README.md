# oVirt Desktop Client

### Description

This project is a simple oVirt-related desktop client. The application will communicate with oVirt via its Python API and provide a list of VMs about which the user has usage privileges, allowing two essential operations:

 1. _Manage power_: Users will be able to shutdown and start their machines.
 2. _Connect to the machine_: The application makes use of _virt-viewer_ to connect to the VM. Both VNC and SPICE protocols are supported.

This application is written in *PyQT5*, and has been verified to be working with oVirt 4.0.0 (should work with any version >= 3.5.0).

**Disclaimer**: This is an **unofficial** oVirt-related project. 

### Installation

1. On Debian/Ubuntu environments, make sure to install these packages: 
   ```
   python python-dev python-virtualenv qt5-default libcurl4-openssl-dev libxml2 libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libssl-dev virt-viewer
   ```

   On RHEL environments, make sure to install these packages:
   ```
   python python-devel python-virtualenv python-pip gcc gcc-c++ qt5-qtbase qt5-qtbase-devel libcurl-devel libxml2 libxml2-devel libxslt-devel openssl-devel virt-viewer
   ```

2. Create the project directory and create a *virtualenv* inside:
   ```
   mkdir ovirt-desktop-client
   cd ovirt-desktop-client
   virtualenv --always-copy venv
   . venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. You have to download the SIP and PyQT5 projects and install them manually. Starting with SIP, [download](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pyqt/files/sip/) the *tar.gz* file to your ~/ovirt_client directory, uncompress it and compile it.
   ```
   tar zxvf sip-X.X.X.tar.gz
   cd sip-X.X.X
   python configure.py
   make
   make install
   cd ..
   ```

4. Let's do the same with [PyQT5](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download5).
   ```
   tar zxvf PyQt-gpl-X.X.tar.gz
   cd PyQt-gpl-X.X
   python configure.py
   make
   make install
   cd ..
   ```

5. Clone the oVirt-desktop-client project:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/nkovacne/ovirt-desktop-client.git
   ```

6. Install the Python requisites with `pip`:
   ```
   pip install -r ovirt-desktop-client/requisites.txt
   ```

7. You're done. Even if you have not configured settings yet, you can try to start the application just to see if it works.
   ```
   python ovirt-desktop-client/ovirtclient.py
   ```
#### Installation troubleshooting

Some environments seem to have their own peculiarities and installing SIP or PyQT5 might not go as smoothly as described above. Here are some known potholes.

##### SIP: Permission denied on make install

This happens when you're working inside a *virtualenv*, probably with an unprivileged user and *make install* will still try to copy files inside `/usr/local/...` instead of your virtualenv. You'll see something like this:

```
make[1]: entering directory « /stck2/stck2.2/ptoniato/python/pip/virtualenv-1.10.1/provaenv/build/SIP/sipgen »
cp -f sip /stck2/stck2.2/ptoniato/python/pip/virtualenv-1.10.1/provaenv/bin/sip
make[1]: leaving directory « /stck2/stck2.2/ptoniato/python/pip/virtualenv-1.10.1/provaenv/build/SIP/sipgen »
make[1]: entering « /stck2/stck2.2/ptoniato/python/pip/virtualenv-1.10.1/provaenv/build/SIP/siplib »
cp -f sip.so /stck2/stck2.2/ptoniato/python/pip/virtualenv-1.10.1/provaenv/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sip.so
strip /stck2/stck2.2/ptoniato/python/pip/virtualenv-1.10.1/provaenv/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sip.so
cp -f /stck2/stck2.2/ptoniato/python/pip/virtualenv-1.10.1/provaenv/build/SIP/siplib/sip.h /usr/local/python/include/python2.7/sip.h
cp: cannot create regular file « /usr/local/python/include/python2.7/sip.h »: Permission denied
make[1]:  [install] Error 1
make[1]: leaving directory « /stck2/stck2.2/ptoniato/python/pip/virtualenv-1.10.1/provaenv/build/SIP/siplib »
make:  [install] Error 2
```

To solve it, run `python configure.py` specifying the include dir (i.e., your virtualenv's include dir where files should actually be installed).

   ```
   python configure.py --incdir=../venv/include/python2.7
   ```

Then, run `make` and `make install` again.

##### PyQT5: Error: Make sure you have a working sip on your PATH or use the --sip argument to explicitly specify a working sip.

This error shows up when the `configure.py` file is unable to find a valid SIP include directory. To solve it, simply force it specifying the `--sip-incdir` option:

   ```
   python configure.py --sip-incdir ../sip-X.X.X/siplib
   ```

### Configuration

To run the application, a file named `settings.conf` must exist in the same directory where the application resides. This file contains 2 sections with a few parameters in each. You can find a `settings.conf.example` file inside the repository so you can base your configuration on it (don't forget to copy/rename it to `settings.conf`).

#### ovirt section

The beggining of this section is marked with the `[ovirt]` line and references some settings that are directly related to the oVirt infrastructure that you mean to connect to. It only has 2 parameters, and both are **mandatory**:

 * **url**: You oVirt infrastructure API URL. If you're using oVirt version 3.6.x, URL should be somewhat like: `https://myovirt.mydomain.com/api`. If you're using oVirt version 4.0.x or greater, URL should be somewhat like: `https://myovirt.mydomain.com/ovirt-engine/api`.
 * **domain**: The domain under which your users will authenticate. When you create an AAA authenticator (LDAP, Kerberos, ...), a domain name is created to match it. This value goes here, so users will authenticate as `username@domain` (Ex: LDAP, MyCompany, ...). It's the 'Profile' field value when you're logging into the oVirt web-based API.
 
#### app section

The beggining of this section is marked with the `[app]` line and references some settings that are directly related to the oVirt desktop client behavior. All of them are **optional** but have some default values.

* **lang**: Chooses the application language. Available languages are stored under the `lang` folder. If you don't see your language, you can translate it and send a push request so I can merge it into the project. Default: en.
* **connection_timeout**: Establishes the number of seconds to wait after sending a request to your oVirt infrastructure after which the request will be considered timed out. Default: 15
* **preferred_protocol**: Some VMs have more than one graphics protocols enabled (i.e, VNC and SPICE) at a time. These VMs allow choosing which one you prefer to use when opening a console window. In case that the VM only has one protocol enabled, this will be used disregarding this parameter. Possible values: spice, vnc. Default: spice
* **fullscreen**: Enables opening the console window as fullscreen or the default size. Possible values: 1 (full screen), 0 (default size). Default: 0
* **allow_remember**: Defines whether show or not the "Remember credentials" checkbox. Some environments might prefer not enabling it (for example, thin-client fashioned terminals). Possible values: 1 (enable the remembering credentials checkbox), 0 (disable the remembering credentials checkbox). Default: 1

## Current version

Current stable version is 1.0.3. You can find a CHANGELOG file inside your directory to see news.
