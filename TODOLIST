* Migrate oVirt code to 4.X.X version. While ovirt-engine-sdk-python version 3.X.X is compatible with oVirt API 4.0.0, in the future this backwards compatibility will be removed. The oVirt code should all be rewritten to 4.X.X format.
* Encrypt somehow the oVirt credentials if stored.
* Implement the "multitenant" mode (showing machines of multiple instances of oVirt into the same application).
* Add support for VmPools
* Implement an "autologout" event after being idle for some time
* Strip HTML tags on unsuccessful auth message
